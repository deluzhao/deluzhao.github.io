Instructions:<br>
1. You will be given sets of four images at a time.<br>
2. Two images will be labelled positive and two will be labelled negative.<br>
3. Image details are hidden until you hover over them with your mouse and right-click to turn on a "flashlight".<br>
4. Your goal is to input observations in a bottom-right input field, such that they are true for both positive images and false for at least one image. Observations can be of any form, including object counts, overarching image concepts, and reasonable opinions.<br>
5. A set of images is considered cleared if a combination of observations that you've made hold true for both positive images and false for both negative images. A solver will automatically determine this in the backend and will change the "Solution: " text if a solution is found, where you should then proceed by pressing the Next button.<br>
6. A "score" is provided in the upper-right corner that increments based on time spent with the flashlight on as motivation for efficient scanning of images. Try to consider optimal strategies for how you may begin and continue looking for observations.<br>
7. The first set of images will only contain one positive and one negative image copied twice as a warm-up.<br>
8. To create a new observation, input a new phrase such as "has a cat" and submit it for a specific image (such as Positive 2) by clicking on that image before pressing enter. An observation will be initialized as {"has a cat": (P1-unknown, P2-true, N1-unknown, N2-unknown)}. Importantly, observations will not be checked for truth, so please<br>verify your observations and ensure that they are true by re-checking images as needed.<br>
9. To work with a previously made observation, use the same phrase and select a different image to submit the observation for. Once an observation is created, please try to finish it by assigning truth values for all four images.<br>
10. The "not" keyword is reserved to indicate false for the observation if and only if the first three characters are "not". Do not use "not" if you are not intending to create a false observation. Working with the previous example, if you input "not has a cat" for Negative 1, you will get {"has a cat": (P1-unknown, P2-true, N1-false, N2-unknown)}.<br>
11. If stuck for more than a minute of flashlight time and you'd like to give up, the reserved "skip" keyword can be used to skip the question.<br>
12. After you press the finish button, the text should change to show your ID. If you'd like to see your input, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P_TKide0qrn6ULAoUuxGllW6wv1p-9jUn4zXKoOqak8/">click here</a>, and scroll down to your entry.
